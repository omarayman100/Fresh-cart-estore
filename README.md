Freshcart is a frontend e-commerce platform built using Angular and Bootstrap, and enhanced with Yup for data validation and Axios for dynamic API integration. This open-source project aims to provide an easy-to-use and customizable online shopping experience for small and medium-sized businesses.

The frontend of Freshcart is built using Angular, a popular framework for building web applications. Angular provides a powerful set of tools for building dynamic and interactive user interfaces, making it an excellent choice for an e-commerce platform. Bootstrap is used to provide a responsive layout and styling for the website, ensuring that it looks great on any device.

To ensure the accuracy of data entered by users, Freshcart uses Yup, a validation library that allows developers to define validation schemas and rules. This helps prevent errors or malicious data from being submitted to the API.

Freshcart is also designed to integrate with dynamic APIs, which are APIs that change frequently or are customized for specific use cases. This is achieved using Axios, a library that simplifies HTTP requests and responses. With Axios, Freshcart can communicate with the API in a safe and efficient manner, ensuring that the platform performs well and is responsive to user actions.

In addition to its core features, Freshcart includes a range of customizable components and templates that can be used to build a unique online store. These components include product listings, shopping carts, checkout forms, and user account pages.

 Freshcart provides a robust and secure user experience that is sure to delight customers and developers alike.
